        Mohinga is a traditional Burmese dish that is often considered the national dish of Myanmar (formerly known as Burma). It is a fish soup or stew made with catfish, lemongrass, ginger, onions, garlic, and other spices, served over thin rice noodles.

It is a popular and flavorful dish that is deeply rooted in Burmese cuisine and culture.
